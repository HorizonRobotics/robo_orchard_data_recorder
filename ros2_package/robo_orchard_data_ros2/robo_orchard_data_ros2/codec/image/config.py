class ImageEncodingConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for image encoding in ROS 2.

    This class defines the configuration used for encoding images,
    including the codec type (JPEG or PNG), the number of workers,
    the maximum queue size, and the mapping between source and
    destination topics.

    Attributes:
        codec (JpegCodecConfig | PngCodecConfig): The image encoding
            codec configuration. Defaults to `PngCodecConfig()`.
        num_workers (int): The number of worker threads for encoding.
            Defaults to 0 (single-threaded execution).
        max_queue_size (int): The maximum size of the encoding task queue.
            Defaults to 0 (unlimited queue size).
        topic_mapping (Mapping[str, str]): A dictionary mapping source
            ROS topics to destination ROS topics.
        queue_full_action (Literal["raise", "drop_last", "drop_first"]): Action
            to take when the task queue is full (i.e., reaches max_queue_size).
            Defaults to "raise".
            Options are:
            - "raise": Raise a TaskQueueFulledError.
            - "drop_last": Discard the newest task (the one being added).
            - "drop_first": Discard the oldest task in the queue.
